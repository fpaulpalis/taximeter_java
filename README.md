Note: This is laughably unrealistic**.** The total fare is too expensive. In a real life example, if you are going to travel from PHINMA UPang College Urdaneta to SM City Rosales, the total kilometers is 10.8 km. The total cost you‚Äôll need to pay is 1,080 Pesos.

</aside>

**Range of 5 - 10 km:** 100 Pesos per kilometer.

**PUCU to SM City Rosales:** 10.8 kilometers.

**Solution:** 10.8 km * 100 pesos = 1,800 Pesos

## **Starting a Ride**

- Once users understand the fare rate ranges, they can initiate a ride and input the distances traveled for each fare calculation.
